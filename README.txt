This is a TARGET ONLY overhaul of Koil/Alberto Golf.
This script includes:

 - Target System  (Ox , QB  , QTarget)
 - Payment Location (pulls from Ox Inventory exclusively)
 - Membership Check (probably overkill on how i set it)
 - Membership Cards ( please create your image for it)
 - Cart Spawn.  (may add separate location for "cart rental" later)
 - Police Alerts for when a player leaves the area with a cart. (will be blank for you to add whatever)
 - Scaleform Maps

Config will handle all locations.


Item:

['lscm'] = {
	label = 'Golf Club Membership',
	weight = 1,
	stack = false,
	close = true,
	description = 'The Most Prestigious Golf Club'
},
